This is a silly webapp that lays out a tarot reading using the method described in the [King in Yellow Tarot][1] from [Arc Dream Publishing][2]

The card images used are from Luciellae's [Rider-Waite Smith Tarot Cards][3] and the meaning hints are copied from the book [The Pictorial Key to the Tarot][4] by Arthur Edward Waite.

This app should be used for entertainment purposes only, and is not to be taken as legal or financial advice.
